# AI-Driven Enterprise Delivery Intelligence
### *The GPS for Engineering Leadership*

> **"Don't just track the traffic jam. Re-route around it."**

## 🚀 The Vision: Active Decision Intelligence
Most engineering analytics tools are **Passive Maps**—they show you where you *were* (velocity charts, commit counts). 
This platform is **Waze/Google Maps for Delivery**. It consumes raw signals (GitHub/Jira) to:
1.  **Predict** delays before they happen ("High Risk: Stalled Critical Path").
2.  **Evaluate** constraints ("Ramp-up time > Deadline").
3.  **Recommend** the best route ("Escalate Dependency" vs. "Add Engineer").

## 💡 Core Innovation: The "Agentic Boardroom"
Instead of a simple dashboard, we deploy a team of AI Agents that "reason" about your project:
*   **🕵️ Risk Agent**: The Skeptic. Detects stalled work and hidden risks.
*   **⚖️ Constraint Agent**: The Realist. Checks if hiring is actually feasible given ramp-up costs.
*   **🧠 Simulation Agent**: The Strategist. Runs "What-If" scenarios to find the optimal path.

## 🎯 Business Impact
| From (Passive Analytics) | To (Active Intelligence) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "We missed the deadline." | "We spotted the stall 3 weeks ago." |
| "We added 5 devs (and got slower)." | "We escalated the blocker instead." |
| "I think we are on track." | "The data says 60% probability of delay." |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **Core**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic (Canonical Event Model).
-   **Intelligence**: **Featherless.ai (Qwen 2.5)** for Explainable Reasoning.
-   **Graph**: NetworkX for Dependency Mapping.
-   **Algorithms**: Constraint-based Optimization & Counterfactual Simulation.

### 🛠️ Strategic Pillars (2026 Readiness)
1.  **Unified Data Architecture**: One "Canonical Event Model" for Code, Tickets, and Approvals.
2.  **Workflow Optimization**: Proactive identification of bottlenecks (e.g., "Approvals taking >48h").
3.  **Privacy & Trust**: Analyzes *Workflow Performance*, not *Individual Surveillance*.
4.  **Operational Efficiency**: The goal is to unlock capacity, not just cut costs.

## 🧠 The Architecture (MVP: Engineering Vertical)
*While the vision encompasses the enterprise, our MVP focuses on the most complex vertical: Engineering Delivery.*

### 1. The "Agents" (Our Virtual Staff)
-   **🕵️ Delivery Risk Agent**: Monitors the "Heartbeat" of projects (Commits, PRs, Tickets).
-   **⚖️ Context & Constraint Agent**: Understands the "Body" (Team capacity, Holidays, Budgets).
-   **🔮 Simulation Agent**: The "Brain" (Predicts outcomes of decisions).
-   **🛡️ Governance Agent**: The "Conscience" (Ensures privacy and compliance).

### 2. User Experience: The "Command Center"
A unified dashboard for Engineering Leaders, PMs, and eventually HR/Finance:
-   **Real-Time Health**: "Project A is Healthy. Project B is At Risk."
-   **Root Cause**: "Project B is stuck due to cross-team dependencies."
-   **Actionable Insights**: "Recommended: Escalate dependency discussion."
